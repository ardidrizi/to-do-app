# React To-Do App - Mini Project

This project is a **To-Do List Application** built using React as part of a mini project. The app allows users to create tasks, mark them as completed, delete tasks, and categorize them as important. It is built to demonstrate core React concepts and features, such as state management, component rendering, and routing.

## Project Overview

This mini project aims to showcase the basic functionality of a React application, utilizing state management, routing, and conditional rendering. The app demonstrates how to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks in a to-do list and offers a responsive UI with smooth animations for task management.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create tasks by entering a task name and marking it as important.
- **Complete Tasks**: Toggle tasks as completed or incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark Important**: Highlight important tasks to prioritize them.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Tasks have animated transitions when marked as completed.
- **Routing**: Use of React Router for navigation between the homepage, task creation page, and task details.
